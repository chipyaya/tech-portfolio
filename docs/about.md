## Experience
### Software Development Engineer Intern, Amazon

- May. 2020 - Aug. 2020
- Santa Clara, CA, U.S. (Remote in TX, U.S)
- Built a diff analysis tool with **Java** and **JavaScript** that helps engineers point out search relevance gaps. Realized by hitting two versions of search service, comparing search responses and displaying the difference by interactive tables.
- Developed a search comparison recall tool in **Java** and **JavaScript** that explores the effectiveness of an **Elasticsearch** query change. Displayed the changes via self-designed recall metrics and visualization of ES top matching hits.

### Machine Learning Intern, KKBOX
- Apr. 2019 - Jul. 2019
- Taipei, Taiwan
- Enhanced **5\%** on F1 score of intention classification model in the smart speaker by applying attention mechanism.
- Implemented a new architecture of the smart speaker to provide transparent responses to users in **Python**

### Undergraduate Research Student, Machine Intelligence and Understanding Lab
- Jul. 2018 - Jun. 2019
- National Taiwan University
- Advisor: Prof. Yun-Nung Chen
- Constructed a multi-stage fusion model to integrate features from different modalities effectively with **Pytorch**.
- Outperformed the released baseline by **12\%** in CIDEr, **7\%** in Bleu score, and **12\%** in human evaluation.

### Undergraduate Research Student, Machine Discovery and Social Network Mining Lab
- Jul. 2016 - Jun. 2019
- National Taiwan University
- Advisor: Prof. Shou-De Lin
- Developed a training method for Entity Network to deal with unseen entities in deep reasoning tasks.
- Improved accuracy by **12\%** over 7/13 of tasks in bAbI dataset when dataset contains unseen tokens.

### Software Engineer Intern, Network System and Service Laboratory, Academia Sinica
- Jul. 2016 - Aug. 2016
- Taipei, Taiwan
